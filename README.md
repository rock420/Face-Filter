# FunFilter
This Project is extension of my [**Facial_keypoint_detection**](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints) Project from udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program.

## Overview
  In this project I implented a Funfilter which currently add **Sunglass** and **Moustache** on faces.Funfilters are use in many places like Facebook,Instagram and many other social networking site. The Key objective here is to accurately place the filter (sunglass, hat or any funny things) on top of the user's face. For this purpose here I have used **Facial Keypoint Detection** using Deep Learning which can locate position of various keypoints of a human face.
